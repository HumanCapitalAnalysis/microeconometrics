    "- RD designs can be invalid if individuals can precisely manipulate the assignment variable - discontinuity rules might generate incentives\n",

    "- If individuals - even while having some influence - are unable to precisely manipulate the assignment variable, a consequence of this is that the variation in treatment near the threshold is randomized as though from a randomized experiment - contrast to IV assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "- RD designs can be analyzed - and tested - like randomized experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Graphical representation of an RD design is helpful and informative, but the visual presentation should not be tilted toward either finding an effect or finding no effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nonparametric estimation does not represent a \"solution\" to functional form issues raised by RD designs. It is therefore helpful to view it as a complement to - rather than a substitute for - parametric estimation.\n",
